# Technical Report: Payroll System Tech Stack

## 1. Executive Summary

This report outlines the recommended technology stack for the payroll system. The proposed architecture leverages a modern, scalable, and secure cloud-based infrastructure. The key technologies include React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and AWS for cloud infrastructure. These technologies were chosen based on their ability to meet the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the RFP, including scalability (REQ-015), performance (REQ-016), and security (REQ-014). This tech stack will provide a robust and maintainable foundation for the payroll system, aligning with the business goals of accurate and timely salary processing (G-001) and compliance (G-002).

## 2. Detailed System Architecture

The system architecture follows a three-tier architecture: presentation (frontend), application (backend), and data (database).

```

### Component Descriptions:

*   **Frontend (React):** Provides the user interface for employees, HR administrators, and system administrators. Handles user interactions, data display, and communication with the backend API.
*   **Backend (Node.js/Express):** Implements the application logic, including salary calculations, tax deductions, and data validation. Exposes RESTful APIs for the frontend to consume.
*   **Database (PostgreSQL):** Stores persistent data, including employee information, salary details, tax rules, and payroll history.
*   **AWS RDS:** Managed PostgreSQL database service on AWS.
*   **AWS EC2/Lambda:** Hosts the Node.js/Express backend application, providing scalable compute resources. Lambda could be used for smaller, event-driven tasks.
*   **AWS S3/CloudFront:** Stores and delivers static assets, such as payslip PDFs and frontend code, using a content delivery network for improved performance.
*   **Accounting Software API:** Enables integration with external accounting software for seamless data synchronization.

### Interaction Patterns:

1.  Users interact with the React frontend to view or manage payroll data.
2.  The React frontend sends API requests to the Node.js/Express backend.
3.  The Node.js/Express backend processes the requests, interacts with the PostgreSQL database, and performs necessary calculations.
4.  The backend returns the results to the frontend for display.
5.  The backend communicates with the Accounting Software API to synchronize financial data.

```

*   **Dependency Graph:**  Tasks are linked in the Gantt chart, showing dependencies.  For example, "Frontend Development" depends on "Tech Stack Setup."
*   **Critical Path Analysis:**  The critical path (highlighted above in the chart with comments) identifies the longest sequence of tasks that must be completed on time for the project to finish on schedule.  Delays in these tasks will directly impact the project completion date.
*   **Resource Requirements:**
    *   Frontend Developers (2)
    *   Backend Developers (2)
    *   Database Administrator (1)
    *   DevOps Engineer (1)
    *   Security Engineer (1)
    *   Project Manager (1)
    *   QA Tester (1)

## 6. Scalability and Performance Engineering

*   **Capacity Models:** The system should be designed to handle a growing number of employees (REQ-015). Capacity planning should consider the number of concurrent users, the volume of payroll transactions, and the storage requirements for historical data. Load testing should be conducted regularly to identify bottlenecks and ensure that the system can meet performance requirements (REQ-016).
*   **Optimization Strategies:**
    *   **Database Optimization:** Indexing frequently queried columns, optimizing SQL queries, and using connection pooling.
    *   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms at the frontend, backend, and database layers to reduce latency and improve response times.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple backend servers to prevent overload and ensure high availability.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Use message queues (e.g., AWS SQS) to handle long-running tasks asynchronously, such as generating payslips and reports.
    *   **Code Optimization:** Profile and optimize code for performance bottlenecks. Use efficient algorithms and data structures.
    *   **CDN:** Use Content Delivery Network to cache and deliver static content like images, JavaScript, and CSS files for faster load times.

## 7. Comprehensive Security Architecture

*   **Authentication:** Implement secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to verify user identity.
*   **Authorization:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality based on user roles (REQ-005, REQ-014).
*   **Data Protection:**
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest using database encryption features (e.g., Transparent Data Encryption in PostgreSQL).
    *   Encrypt data in transit using HTTPS (TLS) for all communication between the frontend, backend, and database.
    *   Implement input validation and output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks.
*   **Network Security:**
    *   Use a firewall to restrict access to the backend and database servers.
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate different components of the system.
*   **Compliance Controls:**
    *   Adhere to relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
    *   Implement audit logging to track user activity and system events.
    *   Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.

## 8. Development Workflow and DevOps Practices

*   **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Use a CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
    *   The pipeline should include steps for code compilation, unit testing, integration testing, security scanning, and deployment to staging and production environments.
*   **Environment Management:**
    *   Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) to provision and manage cloud resources.
    *   Implement a multi-environment setup (development, staging, production) to facilitate testing and release management.
*   **Quality Gates:**
    *   Define quality gates in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that code meets certain quality standards before being deployed to production.
    *   Quality gates should include automated tests, code reviews, and security checks.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   Use Git for version control.

## 9. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Testing:** Test individual components and functions in isolation to ensure that they work as expected.
*   **Integration Testing:** Test the interactions between different components and systems to ensure that they work together correctly.
*   **Performance Testing:** Conduct load testing and stress testing to evaluate the system's performance under different load conditions (REQ-016).
*   **Security Testing:** Perform vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and code reviews to identify and address security vulnerabilities (REQ-014).
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Involve end-users in testing the system to ensure that it meets their requirements and expectations.

## 10. Deployment Architecture

*   **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC):** Use Terraform or CloudFormation to define and manage the cloud infrastructure in a declarative way.
*   **Containerization:** Use Docker to containerize the backend application and deploy it to a container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes).
*   **Scaling Strategies:**
    *   **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more backend servers to handle increased traffic.
    *   **Vertical Scaling:** Increase the resources (CPU, memory) of existing servers.
    *   **Auto-Scaling:** Automatically scale the number of backend servers based on traffic demand.
*   **Monitoring Solutions:**
    *   Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch) to track system performance, identify issues, and alert administrators.
    *   Monitor key metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, network traffic, and response times.

## 11. Operational Support Model

*   **Incident Management:**
    *   Establish a process for reporting, tracking, and resolving incidents.
    *   Define escalation procedures for critical issues.
*   **SLA Frameworks:**
    *   Define service level agreements (SLAs) for system availability, performance, and response times.
    *   Monitor SLA compliance and report on performance against SLAs.
*   **On-Call Support:**
    *   Provide 24/7 on-call support for critical issues.
*   **Maintenance:**
    *   Perform regular maintenance tasks, such as security patching, software updates, and database backups.
