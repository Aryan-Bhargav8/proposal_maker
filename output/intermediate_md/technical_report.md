### 2.2. Component Descriptions

*   **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the API Gateway for high availability and scalability.
*   **API Gateway:** Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, handling authentication, authorization, and routing requests to the appropriate microservices.
*   **Microservices:**
    *   **Authentication Service:** Handles user authentication and authorization (REQ-005, REQ-014, G-017).
    *   **Employee Service:** Manages employee data (REQ-007, G-004, US-004).
    *   **Payroll Calculation Service:** Performs the core payroll calculations (REQ-001, REQ-016, G-001, US-001).
    *   **Tax Calculation Service:** Calculates taxes and ensures compliance (REQ-002, REQ-008, G-002, US-002).
    *   **Reporting Service:** Generates payroll reports and payslips (REQ-004, REQ-009, REQ-013, G-003, G-005, US-003, US-005).
    *   **Integration Service:** Handles integration with external systems such as accounting software and attendance/leave management systems (REQ-003, REQ-006, REQ-012, G-010, G-018, US-007, US-012).
*   **Databases:**
    *   **User Database:** Stores user credentials and role information.
    *   **Employee Data Database:** Stores employee-related information (e.g., personal details, salary, benefits).
    *   **Payroll Data Database:** Stores payroll calculation results and history.
    *   **Tax Rules Database:** Stores tax rules and regulations.
*   **Message Queue:** Enables asynchronous communication between microservices, improving system resilience and scalability (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
*   **External Systems:** Represents integrations with external accounting software and attendance/leave management systems.

### 2.3. Interaction Patterns

*   Clients (e.g., web browser, mobile app) send requests to the API Gateway.
*   The API Gateway authenticates and authorizes the request.
*   The API Gateway routes the request to the appropriate microservice.
*   Microservices interact with databases to retrieve and store data.
*   Microservices communicate with each other asynchronously via the Message Queue for tasks like reporting and integration.
