# Technical Report: Payroll System Tech Stack

## 1. Executive Summary

This report outlines the recommended technology stack for developing a robust, scalable, and secure payroll system. The proposed architecture leverages modern technologies and industry best practices to meet the functional and non-functional requirements defined in the RFP. Key recommendations include:

*   **Frontend:** React with TypeScript for a responsive and maintainable user interface (US-013, US-014).
*   **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java) for building a scalable and secure API (US-003, US-005).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL for reliable data storage (US-001, US-002).
*   **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS for scalable and cost-effective deployment (REQ-015).
*   **DevOps:** Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes for CI/CD and container orchestration.
*   **Security:** Implement comprehensive security measures including encryption, role-based access control, and regular security audits (REQ-014, REQ-015).

These recommendations are strategically aligned with the business goals of accurate and timely salary processing, compliance with tax regulations, efficient payslip generation, and data security.

### 2.2 Component Descriptions

*   **React Frontend:** The user interface layer, built with React and TypeScript, provides a responsive and intuitive experience for users to interact with the system. It handles user input, displays data, and communicates with the backend API.
*   **Spring Boot API:** The backend API layer, built with Spring Boot (Java), exposes RESTful endpoints for the frontend to consume. It handles business logic, data validation, and interacts with the database.
*   **PostgreSQL Database:** The data storage layer, using PostgreSQL, stores all persistent data for the system, including employee details, salary information, tax rules, and user accounts.
*   **Authentication Service:** A dedicated service to handle authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the system.

### 2.3 Interaction Patterns

1.  The user interacts with the React Frontend to perform actions like adding employee details or viewing payslips.
2.  The React Frontend sends HTTPS requests to the Spring Boot API to perform backend operations.
3.  The Spring Boot API processes the requests, performs necessary data validation and business logic, and interacts with the PostgreSQL Database to retrieve or store data.
4.  The Spring Boot API returns the results to the React Frontend for display to the user.
5.  All API requests are authenticated using the Authentication Service.
