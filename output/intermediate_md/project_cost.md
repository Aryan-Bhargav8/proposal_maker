# Project Cost Calculation Report

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the estimated project cost for developing the payroll system, based on the assumed project team composition, duration, and standard working hours. The calculation follows a structured approach to ensure transparency and justification of the estimated budget.

## 2. Assumptions

The following assumptions have been made for this cost estimation:

*   **Project Team Composition:** A dedicated team with specific roles is assigned to the project for its entire duration. The roles are based on the typical skill sets required for developing a system of this complexity, addressing the user stories and requirements outlined in the project context.
*   **Project Duration:** The project is estimated to take **20 weeks** to complete.
*   **Working Hours:** Each team member works a standard full-time schedule of **8 hours per day**.
*   **Working Days per Week:** The standard work week is **5 days**.
*   **Hourly Rates:** Illustrative hourly rates have been assigned to each role. These rates are estimates and may vary based on actual personnel experience and market conditions.
*   **Full Allocation:** All team members are assumed to be allocated **100%** to this project for the entire duration.
*   **Contingency Buffer:** A **20%** contingency buffer is added to the total calculated cost to account for unforeseen risks, scope changes, or delays.

## 3. Calculation Methodology

The project cost is calculated based on the following formulas:

*   `Hours per Week per Member = 5 days/week * 8 hours/day = 40 hours/week`
*   `Total Hours per Member = Hours per Week per Member * Total Number of Weeks`
*   `Cost per Member = Total Hours per Member * Hourly Rate`
*   `Total Project Cost (excluding buffer) = Sum of Cost per Member for all team members`
*   `Contingency Buffer Amount = 20% * Total Project Cost (excluding buffer)`
*   `Total Project Budget (including buffer) = Total Project Cost (excluding buffer) + Contingency Buffer Amount`

## 4. Assumed Project Team and Hourly Rates

Based on the project scope, the assumed team composition and their illustrative hourly rates are as follows:

| Role                         | Number of Members | Assumed Hourly Rate |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------ |
| Project Manager              | 1                 | $120                |
| Business Analyst             | 1                 | $100                |
| Software Architect           | 1                 | $150                |
| Backend Developer            | 2                 | $110                |
| Frontend Developer           | 1                 | $110                |
| QA Tester                    | 1                 | $90                 |
| DevOps Engineer              | 1                 | $130                |

## 5. Detailed Cost Breakdown per Team Member

Based on the assumed 20-week project duration and 40 hours per week per member, the total hours worked per member is `40 hours/week * 20 weeks = 800 hours`.

The cost for each team member is calculated as follows:

*   **Project Manager:**
    *   Total Hours: 800 hours
    *   Hourly Rate: $120
    *   Cost: `800 hours * $120/hour = $96,000`

*   **Business Analyst:**
    *   Total Hours: 800 hours
    *   Hourly Rate: $100
    *   Cost: `800 hours * $100/hour = $80,000`

*   **Software Architect:**
    *   Total Hours: 800 hours
    *   Hourly Rate: $150
    *   Cost: `800 hours * $150/hour = $120,000`

*   **Backend Developer (Member 1):**
    *   Total Hours: 800 hours
    *   Hourly Rate: $110
    *   Cost: `800 hours * $110/hour = $88,000`

*   **Backend Developer (Member 2):**
    *   Total Hours: 800 hours
    *   Hourly Rate: $110
    *   Cost: `800 hours * $110/hour = $88,000`

*   **Frontend Developer:**
    *   Total Hours: 800 hours
    *   Hourly Rate: $110
    *   Cost: `800 hours * $110/hour = $88,000`

*   **QA Tester:**
    *   Total Hours: 800 hours
    *   Hourly Rate: $90
    *   Cost: `800 hours * $90/hour = $72,000`

*   **DevOps Engineer:**
    *   Total Hours: 800 hours
    *   Hourly Rate: $130
    *   Cost: `800 hours * $130/hour = $104,000`

## 6. Summary of Project Cost (Excluding Contingency)

The total project cost before adding the contingency buffer is the sum of the costs for all team members:

| Role                 | Number | Total Hours | Hourly Rate | Cost        |
| :------------------- | :----- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Project Manager      | 1      | 800         | $120        | $96,000     |
| Business Analyst     | 1      | 800         | $100        | $80,000     |
| Software Architect   | 1      | 800         | $150        | $120,000    |
| Backend Developer    | 2      | 1600        | $110        | $176,000    |
| Frontend Developer   | 1      | 800         | $110        | $88,000     |
| QA Tester            | 1      | 800         | $90         | $72,000     |
| DevOps Engineer      | 1      | 800         | $130        | $104,000    |
| **Subtotal**         | **8**  | **7200**    |             | **$736,000**|

*Note: Total hours for Backend Developer is 2 members * 800 hours/member = 1600 hours.*

Total Project Cost (excluding buffer) = **$736,000**

## 7. Contingency Calculation

A 20% contingency buffer is added to the total cost to cover potential unforeseen circumstances.

*   Contingency Buffer Amount = 20% of $736,000
*   Contingency Buffer Amount = `0.20 * $736,000 = $147,200`

## 8. Total Project Budget (Including Contingency)

The total estimated project budget includes the calculated cost plus the contingency buffer.

*   Total Project Budget = Total Project Cost (excluding buffer) + Contingency Buffer Amount
*   Total Project Budget = `$736,000 + $147,200 = $883,200`

## 9. Summary Table: Total Project Budget

| Item                                  | Amount      |
| :------------------------------------ | :---------- |
| Total Project Cost (excluding buffer) | $736,000    |
| Contingency Buffer (20%)              | $147,200    |
| **Total Project Budget**              | **$883,200**|

## 10. Notes and Justification

*   The cost estimation is based on the stated assumptions regarding team composition, duration, and rates. Any changes to these assumptions will directly impact the total project cost.
*   The assumed hourly rates are illustrative and should be validated based on the actual resources assigned to the project.
*   The 20-week duration is an estimate based on the complexity implied by the user stories and requirements. A detailed project plan and scope definition would provide a more accurate timeline.
*   The contingency buffer is a standard practice to manage project risks. The actual amount used will depend on how effectively risks are managed throughout the project lifecycle.
*   This cost breakdown focuses solely on personnel costs based on time and rate. It does not include other potential project costs such as software licenses, hardware, third-party services, travel, or overheads, which should be considered for a complete financial plan.
*   The team composition is designed to cover key areas like project management, business analysis, architecture, development (backend and frontend), quality assurance, and system operations/infrastructure. The number of resources per role is an estimate for a project of this assumed scale and duration.
