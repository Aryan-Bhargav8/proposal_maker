# Project Cost Estimation Report

This report details the estimated cost for the project based on the assumed team composition and project duration. The calculations are transparent and follow a structured approach to provide a comprehensive project budget.

## Assumptions

*   **Team Composition:** The project team consists of the following roles: Project Manager, Senior Developer, Developer, QA Engineer, and Business Analyst.
*   **Hourly Rates:** Assumed hourly rates for each role based on industry averages (these should be replaced with actual rates for a final proposal).
*   **Project Duration:** The project is estimated to take 12 weeks.
*   **Work Schedule:** Each team member works 5 days per week, 8 hours per day.
*   **Contingency Buffer:** A 20% buffer is added to the total estimated cost to account for unforeseen circumstances or scope changes.

## Calculation Methodology

The project cost is calculated based on the following steps:

1.  **Calculate Weekly Hours:** Weekly Hours = 5 days/week * 8 hours/day = 40 hours/week
2.  **Calculate Total Hours per Member:** Total Hours = Weekly Hours * Project Duration (in weeks)
3.  **Calculate Cost per Member:** Cost per Member = Total Hours per Member * Hourly Rate per Member
4.  **Calculate Total Base Project Cost:** Sum of Cost per Member for all team members.
5.  **Calculate Contingency Buffer:** Contingency = Total Base Project Cost * 20%
6.  **Calculate Final Total Project Cost:** Final Total Cost = Total Base Project Cost + Contingency Buffer

## Team Member Cost Breakdown

Below is the detailed cost breakdown for each team member:

| Role              | Assumed Hourly Rate | Weekly Hours | Project Duration (Weeks) | Total Hours | Cost per Member |
| :---------------- | :------------------ | :----------- | :----------------------- | :---------- | :-------------- |
| Project Manager   | $100                | 40           | 12                       | 480         | $48,000         |
| Senior Developer  | $90                 | 40           | 12                       | 480         | $43,200         |
| Developer         | $75                 | 40           | 12                       | 480         | $36,000         |
| QA Engineer       | $60                 | 40           | 12                       | 480         | $28,800         |
| Business Analyst  | $85                 | 40           | 12                       | 480         | $40,800         |

*Note: Total Hours per Member = 40 hours/week * 12 weeks = 480 hours*

## Summary Table

| Cost Item                 | Amount    |
| :------------------------ | :-------- |
| Total Base Project Cost   | $196,800  |
| Contingency Buffer (20%)  | $39,360   |
| **Final Total Project Cost** | **$236,160** |

## Detailed Cost Calculation

*   **Project Manager:** 480 hours * $100/hour = $48,000
*   **Senior Developer:** 480 hours * $90/hour = $43,200
*   **Developer:** 480 hours * $75/hour = $36,000
*   **QA Engineer:** 480 hours * $60/hour = $28,800
*   **Business Analyst:** 480 hours * $85/hour = $40,800

**Total Base Project Cost:** $48,000 + $43,200 + $36,000 + $28,800 + $40,800 = $196,800

**Contingency Buffer (20%):** $196,800 * 0.20 = $39,360

**Final Total Project Cost:** $196,800 + $39,360 = $236,160

## Notes

*   The assumed hourly rates are estimates and should be verified.
*   The project duration is an estimate and may change based on project scope evolution or unforeseen challenges.
*   The contingency buffer is included to mitigate risks; actual costs may be lower if the buffer is not fully utilized.
*   This cost estimate covers personnel costs only and does not include other potential project expenses such as software licenses, hardware, travel, or third-party services. These should be added for a complete project budget.
*   The calculation assumes full-time allocation (40 hours/week) for all team members throughout the project duration. If team members are part-time or their allocation varies, the total hours calculation would need to be adjusted accordingly.
