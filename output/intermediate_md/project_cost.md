# Project Cost Estimation Report

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the estimated project costs based on the assumed team composition, project duration, and hourly rates. The calculation follows a structured approach to ensure transparency and justification.

## 1. Assumptions

The following assumptions have been made for this cost estimation:

*   **Project Duration:** The project is estimated to take **12 weeks** to complete.
*   **Standard Work Week:** A standard work week consists of **5 days**.
*   **Standard Work Day:** A standard work day consists of **8 hours**.
*   **Hours per Week per Full-Time Member:** Based on the standard work week and day, a full-time team member works **40 hours per week** (5 days/week * 8 hours/day).
*   **Team Composition:** The project team consists of the following roles and number of full-time equivalent (FTE) members:
    *   Project Manager: 1 FTE
    *   Business Analyst: 1 FTE
    *   Software Developer: 3 FTEs
    *   QA Tester: 1 FTE
    *   DevOps/System Admin: 0.5 FTE (part-time)
*   **Hourly Pay Rates:** The following illustrative hourly pay rates are assumed for each role:
    *   Project Manager: $100/hour
    *   Business Analyst: $90/hour
    *   Software Developer: $80/hour
    *   QA Tester: $70/hour
    *   DevOps/System Admin: $95/hour
*   **Contingency Buffer:** A **20% buffer** is added to the total calculated cost to account for unforeseen circumstances, scope changes, or risks.

## 2. Calculation Formulas

The cost calculation is based on the following formulas:

*   `Hours per Week = 5 days/week * 8 hours/day`
*   `Total Hours per Member = Hours per Week * Project Duration (in weeks) * Member's FTE`
*   `Cost per Member = Total Hours per Member * Member's Hourly Pay Rate`
*   `Total Base Project Cost = Sum of Cost per Member for all team members`
*   `Contingency Buffer Amount = Total Base Project Cost * 20%`
*   `Total Project Cost = Total Base Project Cost + Contingency Buffer Amount`

## 3. Detailed Cost Breakdown per Team Member

Below is the detailed cost calculation for each team member based on the assumptions and formulas.

*   **Standard Hours per Week:** 40 hours
*   **Total Project Weeks:** 12 weeks

### 3.1. Project Manager

*   **Role:** Project Manager
*   **FTE:** 1
*   **Hourly Rate:** $100
*   **Total Hours:** `1 FTE * 40 hours/week * 12 weeks = 480 hours`
*   **Cost:** `480 hours * $100/hour = $48,000`

### 3.2. Business Analyst

*   **Role:** Business Analyst
*   **FTE:** 1
*   **Hourly Rate:** $90
*   **Total Hours:** `1 FTE * 40 hours/week * 12 weeks = 480 hours`
*   **Cost:** `480 hours * $90/hour = $43,200`

### 3.3. Software Developer

*   **Role:** Software Developer
*   **FTE:** 3
*   **Hourly Rate:** $80
*   **Total Hours per Developer:** `1 FTE * 40 hours/week * 12 weeks = 480 hours`
*   **Total Hours for all Developers:** `3 FTEs * 480 hours/FTE = 1440 hours`
*   **Cost:** `1440 hours * $80/hour = $115,200`

### 3.4. QA Tester

*   **Role:** QA Tester
*   **FTE:** 1
*   **Hourly Rate:** $70
*   **Total Hours:** `1 FTE * 40 hours/week * 12 weeks = 480 hours`
*   **Cost:** `480 hours * $70/hour = $33,600`

### 3.5. DevOps/System Admin

*   **Role:** DevOps/System Admin
*   **FTE:** 0.5
*   **Hourly Rate:** $95
*   **Total Hours:** `0.5 FTE * 40 hours/week * 12 weeks = 240 hours`
*   **Cost:** `240 hours * $95/hour = $22,800`

## 4. Total Base Project Cost

The total base project cost is the sum of the costs for all team members.

*   **Total Base Project Cost:** `$48,000 (PM) + $43,200 (BA) + $115,200 (Dev) + $33,600 (QA) + $22,800 (DevOps) = $262,800`

## 5. Contingency Buffer

A 20% contingency buffer is added to the total base project cost.

*   **Contingency Buffer Amount:** `20% of $262,800 = 0.20 * $262,800 = $52,560`

## 6. Total Project Budget

The total project budget includes the total base project cost and the contingency buffer.

*   **Total Project Budget:** `$262,800 (Base Cost) + $52,560 (Buffer) = $315,360`

## 8. Notes

*   The hourly rates used in this estimation are illustrative and should be adjusted based on actual market rates, team member experience, and location.
*   The team composition and project duration are estimates and may need to be revised based on a more detailed scope definition and project planning.
*   The 20% contingency buffer is a standard practice but can be adjusted based on the project's complexity and risk assessment.
*   This cost estimation primarily covers personnel costs. Additional project costs (e.g., software licenses, infrastructure, third-party services, travel) are not included in this calculation and should be estimated separately.
*   The calculation assumes a consistent workload throughout the 12 weeks for all team members at their specified FTE level.

This report provides a transparent and justifiable basis for the project's personnel cost estimation, suitable for inclusion in a project proposal document.
