*   Encrypting sensitive data.
*   Integrating with external systems for attendance/leave data and accounting entries.
*   Providing an Employee Self-Service portal for payslip viewing and tax declaration updates.

## Sub-Systems

The system is composed of the following key sub-systems:

### Frontend

Developed using React with TypeScript, this sub-system provides the user interface for administrators and employees. It handles user interactions, data presentation, and communicates with the Backend API via secure HTTPS requests.

### Backend API

Built with Spring Boot (Java), this sub-system contains the core business logic for payroll processing, tax calculations, data validation, and integration with external systems. It exposes RESTful APIs consumed by the Frontend and interacts with the Database. Spring Security is integrated here for authentication and authorization.

### Database

Utilizing PostgreSQL, this sub-system is the persistent data store for all system information, including employee details, salary history, tax configurations, payroll runs, and user data. Its relational structure and ACID compliance ensure data integrity.

### Authentication Service

A dedicated component (potentially part of the Spring Boot application or a separate microservice) responsible for user authentication and managing user sessions and tokens. It verifies user credentials and provides identity information to the Backend API for authorization decisions.

### Integration Modules

Specific components within the Backend API responsible for communicating with external systems, such as fetching attendance/leave data from the attendance system and pushing payroll journal entries to the accounting software. These modules handle data mapping and transfer protocols.
